### Automatic Test with genetic algorithm and Ml algorithms

This is my B.Sc. research project on Algorithms for automated testing in software â€œusing
Genetic Algorithm (GA) and machine learning algorithms (SVM and Decision Tree). With a given code, traced
all the possible paths, generated test cases and ruled out paths that could not logically happen with different
algorithms mentioned above. Analyzed which algorithms had more accurate results.
